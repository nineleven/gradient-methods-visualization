# Gradient methods visualization

This is my student project for a python programming course at SPbSTU.
The program takes an arbitrary function, automatically differentiates it using sympy library and visualizes iterations of [BFGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno_algorithm) optimization method, applied to this function.
